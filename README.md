# Automated Data Labeling Using CLIP

## Introduction

Welcome to our repository, where we tackle one of the fundamental challenges in the realm of image classification and object detection tasks: the scarcity of labeled data. Our solution is an innovative pipeline designed to automate the data labeling process, harnessing the power of the OpenAI CLIP model.

### The Challenge

In many machine learning projects, especially those involving image classification and object detection mechanisms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), a significant bottleneck is the availability of accurately labeled data. Manually labeling datasets can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. This limitation often hampers the development and accuracy of machine learning models.

### Our Solution

Our pipeline addresses this challenge head-on by automating the data labeling process. At the heart of our solution is the OpenAI CLIP model, a cutting-edge tool known for its ability to understand and categorize images based on textual descriptions.

### How It Works

The pipeline operates by leveraging CLIP's unique capability to correlate text and images. It begins with generating descriptive prompts for the images in the dataset. These prompts are then fed into the CLIP model, which effectively categorizes the images based on the provided textual descriptions. This process not only accelerates the labeling of data but also enhances the accuracy and diversity of the labels, thus enriching the dataset.

### End Goal

The primary objective of this pipeline is to streamline and optimize the data preparation phase for image classification and object detection tasks. By automating the labeling process, we aim to expedite the development of machine learning models, enabling them to be trained on well-labeled, diverse datasets with minimal human intervention.

We invite you to explore our repository, contribute, and leverage this pipeline for your image classification and object detection projects.
